# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an optimized closed-loop workflow command system for Claude Code that integrates project planning, task management, and development workflows.

**🚀 Quick Start**: New users can be productive with just 4 Essential Commands (80% of use cases)
**🔄 Context Continuity**: Uses PLANNING.md, TASK.md, and CONTEXT.md to maintain context across `/clear` boundaries
**⚡ Streamlined**: 13 commands organized by development lifecycle stages
**🛡️ Quality Gates**: Built-in formatting, testing, and validation

## Command Overview

All commands follow the `wf_<number>_<name>.md <ARGUMENTS>` format where:
- **Numbered prefixes** indicate typical usage order in workflows
- **Arguments** specify the target scope (feature, component, error, etc.)
- **Multi-agent coordination** used for complex tasks with specialized roles
- **Progressive development** with validation at each step

## Key Files (Closed Loop)

### PRD.md (Requirements Source)
Project Requirements Document - read-only reference containing:
- Official project requirements and specifications
- Business objectives and success criteria
- Stakeholder requirements and constraints
- **CRITICAL**: Never automatically modified by commands
- **ROLE**: Source of truth for all project decisions

### PLANNING.md
Technical architecture document aligned with PRD.md containing:
- Project overview and goals (derived from PRD.md)
- System architecture and design (meeting PRD requirements)
- Technology stack and tools (supporting PRD objectives)
- Development standards and patterns
- Testing and deployment strategies
- PRD compliance checklist

### TASK.md
Dynamic task tracking document containing:
- Categorized task lists (mapped to PRD requirements)
- Task status and progress
- Dependencies and blockers
- Completion history
- PRD requirement traceability

### CONTEXT.md (New)
Session state and progress summary containing:
- Work completed in recent sessions
- Key decisions made (with PRD alignment notes)
- Current focus areas
- Next priority items
- Auto-updated by wf_11_commit.md for seamless session continuity

## Command Integration Rules

1. **PRD Compliance**: All commands must reference and align with PRD.md requirements (read-only, never modify)
2. **Context Loading**: Commands should read PRD.md for requirements, PLANNING.md for standards, TASK.md for status, and CONTEXT.md for session state
3. **Progress Updates**: Commands that complete work should update TASK.md with PRD requirement traceability
4. **Standard Enforcement**: All code generation follows PLANNING.md guidelines aligned with PRD requirements
5. **Documentation**: Significant decisions update PLANNING.md with PRD alignment justification
6. **Task Generation**: Issues and improvements create TASK.md entries mapped to PRD requirements
7. **Session Continuity**: wf_11_commit.md auto-updates CONTEXT.md for seamless wf_03_prime.md loading
8. **Integrated Operations**: Formatting, coverage analysis, and fixing are integrated into main commands

## Multi-Agent Coordination

The cc_commands workflow system uses a multi-agent approach with specialized roles:

- **Architect Agent** - High-level design and structure analysis
- **Implementation Engineer** - Core functionality development following standards
- **Integration Specialist** - System compatibility and dependency management
- **Code Reviewer** - Quality validation and standards compliance
- **Test Specialists** - Various testing strategies (unit, integration, coverage)
- **Structure Analyst** - Code architecture evaluation and improvement
- **Design Pattern Expert** - Pattern application for maintainability
- **Debug Coordinator** - Systematic error analysis and resolution
- **Performance Optimizer** - System performance analysis and tuning

Each command orchestrates relevant specialists to ensure comprehensive coverage of development tasks while maintaining consistency with project standards and PRD requirements.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow patterns established in existing code
- Maintain test coverage requirements
- Auto-formatting applied by wf_11_commit.md (Python: black, JS/TS: prettier, C++: clang-format, Go: gofmt)
- **No trailing whitespace**: All files must be free of trailing spaces and tabs
- **Consistent line endings**: Use Unix-style line endings (LF)
- Document significant changes

### Pre-commit Quality Checks
Before any commit, run these validation commands:
```bash
# Check for trailing whitespace
grep -n " $" *.md && echo "❌ Found trailing whitespace" || echo "✅ No trailing whitespace"

# Check for mixed line endings
file *.md | grep -v "ASCII text" && echo "❌ Non-standard file format" || echo "✅ Clean file formats"
```

### Git Workflow
- Semantic commit messages ([feat], [fix], [docs], [refactor])
- Task references in commits
- **Mandatory quality checks**: Run pre-commit validation before every commit
- Auto-formatting integrated into wf_11_commit.md
- Auto-update TASK.md and CONTEXT.md after commits
- Consider splitting logically separate changes into different commits

### Quality Gate Enforcement
The `wf_11_commit.md` command MUST include these checks:
1. **Whitespace validation**: Reject commits with trailing whitespace
2. **File format validation**: Ensure consistent line endings
3. **Auto-formatting**: Apply language-specific formatters
4. **Lint checks**: Run relevant linters before commit

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain coverage targets using wf_07_test.md --coverage
- Test before deployment
- Document test strategy in PLANNING.md

### Error Debugging Process
Follow the systematic approach in `wf_06_debug.md`:
1. Analyze complete error output with detailed classification
2. Research using available tools (context7 MCP, brave-search MCP)
3. Implement targeted fixes addressing root causes
4. Verify fixes by re-running original commands
5. Iterate if new errors appear
6. Document solutions for future reference

## Best Practices

1. **Start Sessions with Prime**: Always run `wf_03_prime.md` after `/clear`
2. **Update Tasks Regularly**: Keep TASK.md current with progress
3. **Document Decisions**: Update PLANNING.md with architectural changes
4. **Test Continuously**: Run tests after significant changes
5. **Review Before Commit**: Use `wf_08_review.md` for quality checks
6. **Quality First**: Run pre-commit checks to catch whitespace, formatting issues
7. **Let Commit Handle Everything**: wf_11_commit.md includes quality gates, formatting, and validation

## Troubleshooting

### Lost Context
- Run `wf_03_prime.md` to reload from all core files
- Check CONTEXT.md for latest session state
- Review PLANNING.md for architecture
- Review TASK.md for current state

### Unclear Requirements
- Use `wf_04_ask.md` for consultation
- Update PLANNING.md with decisions
- Create tasks in TASK.md

### Quality Issues
- Run `wf_08_review.md` for assessment
- Apply `wf_09_refactor.md` for improvements
- Verify with `wf_07_test.md --coverage`

### Code Quality Problems
- **Trailing whitespace found**: Run `grep -n " $" *.md` to identify, then clean manually
- **Commit rejected by quality gates**: Fix whitespace and formatting issues first
- **Mixed line endings**: Use `dos2unix` or configure editor to use Unix LF endings
- **Formatting inconsistent**: Let `wf_11_commit.md` handle auto-formatting
