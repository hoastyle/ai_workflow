##                                                                                   Development Philosophy Evolution

### Core Principles (Consistent across versions)
1. **Maintain Context** - Use PLANNING.md, TASK.md, and CONTEXT.md as persistent stores
2. **Enable Continuity** - Allow work to continue across `/clear` boundaries
3. **Track Progress** - Automatically update task status throughout development
4. **Enforce Standards** - Apply consistent patterns and quality gates
5. **Close the Loop** - Each command integrates with others for complete workflows
6. **Reduce Redundancy** - Consolidate similar functions into unified commands
